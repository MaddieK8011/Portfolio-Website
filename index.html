        <p>Hello! My name is Madeline, but you can call me Maddie. I'm a student at Georgia Tech studying Computational Media. I grew up just a short drive away, in the suburbs around Atlanta, so this city has been home my whole life. Out of college, I'm hoping to make a career in Game Design. When I'm not playing or learning about games, I love travelling, finding cool coffee shops and small businesses around Atlanta, playing guitar, baking sweets, and watching trash tv.</p>
